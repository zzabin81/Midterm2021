Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.  programming language is a formal language comprising a set of strings

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?

A. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment
used for developing Java applications and applets.
It includes the:
JRE (Java Runtime Environment) or JRE:
is a software layer that runs on top of a computer’s operating system software and provides the class
libraries and other resources that a specific Java program needs to run.
an interpreter/loader (java):
Java interpreter is a computer program (system software)
that implements the JVM(java virtual machine). It is responsible for reading and executing the program.
A Java compiler:
is a program that takes the text
file work of a developer and compiles it into a platform-independent Java file.
Java compilers include the Java Programming Language Compiler (javac),
the GNU Compiler for Java (GCJ), the Eclipse Compiler for Java (ECJ) and Jikes.
n archiver (jar):
a documentation generator (javadoc) and
other tools needed in Java development.

A.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A. JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that is platform-dependent and has three notions
as a specification, a document that describes requirement of JVM implementation, implementation, a computer program
 that meets JVM requirements, and instance, an implementation that executes Java byte code provides a runtime
  environment for executing Java byte code.
  JVM on other hand specifies all the implementations and responsible to provide these implementations to JRE.
  JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is the implementation of JVM and is defined as a software package
  that provides Java class libraries, along with Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
  and other components to run applications written in Java programming.
  JRE is majorly responsible for creating environment for code execution.
What is compile time and run time?
A. Compile-time is the time at which the source code is converted into an executable code
   while the run time is the time at which the executable code is started running.

What is heap?
A. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease
 in size while the application runs.

How java manage it's memory?
A. Java does memory management automatically.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A.

What is Singleton class?
A. Singleton is a design pattern that ensures that a class can only have one object.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A. .Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
   Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory

when to use transient variable in java?
A. The transient modifier can be used where there are data members
derived from the other data members within the same instance of the class.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A. While loop check condition before iteration of the loop. On the other hand,
   the do-while loop verifies the condition after the execution of the statements inside the loop.

What is Enum?
A. An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants.

What is Iterator?
A. An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A. An Integer object will take more memory an Integer is the an object and it store meta data
overhead about the object and int is primitive type so its takes less space.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
A. The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency,
 caching, and class loading.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
A. Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor
with respect to current object.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A. A serial collector is a default copying collector
   which uses only one GC thread for the GC operation,
   while a parallel collector uses multiple GC threads for the GC operation.

What is JIT stands for?
A. Just-In-Time (JIT).

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A. The Java heap is the area of memory used to store objects instantiated by
applications running on the JVM.Java Garbage Collection is the process by which
Java programs perform automatic memory management.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A. No, Garbage collection does not guarantee that a program will not run out of memory.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A. Java Heap Space is used throughout the application, but Stack is only used
for the method — or methods — currently running.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A. Reflection in Java is the ability to examine and/or modify the properties or behavior of an object at run-time.
   It is useful because it allows an executing Java program to examine or "introspect" upon itself,
   and manipulate internal properties of the program.

what is multithreading in java?
A. Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program
   for maximum utilization of CPU.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A. Synchronization in java is the capability to control the access of multiple
threads to any shared resource.

What is Framework?
A. Java frameworks are specific to the Java programming language.
    It's a Java platform for developing software applications and Java programs.

A. They are:
   1. Selenium
   2. Serenity
   3. JUnit
   4. TestingNG
   5. Cucumber
   6. JBehave
   7. Mockito

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A. JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java programming language.
   TestNG is built over JUnit and NUnit and provides more features for testing an application.

What are the dependencies for this project?
A. A relationships between products or tasks.

what is dependency injection in java?
 Dependency injection(DI) is the concept in which objects get other required objects from outside.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A. Static binding uses Type information for binding
   while Dynamic binding uses Objects to resolve binding.
